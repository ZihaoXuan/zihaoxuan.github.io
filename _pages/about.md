I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and a member of the [AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems](https://inno-access.hk/)(ACCESS) under InnoHK. He received the B.S. degree in mechano-electronic engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2017, and the Ph.D. Degree in electronic science and technology from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Yi Kang. My research interest includes efficient neural network algorithms and their implementation on chips, and I have published more than 16 papers at the top international conferences and journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v9wNPcgAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>250+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v9wNPcgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). You can find more information through my [CV](../images/CanadaCast_CV_example.pdf). Welcome to contact with me if you have any interests.
